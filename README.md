# SliderPuzzle
Uses Java to create a simulation for the "slider puzzle" game. 
This does not work for greater structures. You have to pass in a txt file with the nxn board you have. The first line is n, which is the value for the width. Then, the code will read it further and find the quickest way to solve the board.
